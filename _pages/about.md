I am a data engineer currently based in MÃ¡laga, Spain. My skills are focused on development and data engineering such as data pipelines (ETL) to build business reports and KPIs, collaborating with multiple areas and supplying their needs using Python, SQL, MongoDB, Docker, PowerBI and QlikSense. This has been my primary field for the last 9 years.

Besides programming, I like to spend my free time on the beach and exploring the city. When not outside, I like to play Switch, solve puzzles at CodeWars and learn new things, currently being Kafka, Java, Scala.
